Abstract:
What knowledge is stored in Language models? How can we extract it? 

In this workshop, we will introduce you to probing; a method to explore what information could implicitly be stored in Language Models such as BERT. 

We will talk about the applications and limitations of probing, and run some probing experiments ourselves.

Bring your laptop if you want to take a crack at it yourself! No prior programming skills required.
